title: GSoC Cohort Calls
---

In order to give students a good sense of community, and to help them learn about the software they'll be working on, organisations may wish run several full-group calls throughout GSoC (or whatever other internship program you are running, such as Outreachy or MLH Fellowships). Try to use a video call platform that allows breakout rooms for this, such as a paid  [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) account.

## Application period webinar

During the application period, we usually run a recorded call for all interested attendees. This covers the following topics:  
- testimonials and application from students in previous years
- mentors discussing the goals of each project and answer any applicant questions

## Accepted projects

Accepted students are invited to participate in the following calls:  

### At the start of internships: **Kick-off**
 **Who attends:** students, as many mentors as possible  
 **Call template:** [GitHub](call-templates/kick-off-call), [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@yoyehudi/Hk3wd-ZPr)
  - Tell the students/interns about
    - the org and general roadmap
    - working policies for the next few months
    - what to do if they're struggling and things go wrong (coding trouble, illness, missing or nonresponsive mentor, family emergency, etc.)
  - students introduce themselves and their project plans
  - group activity: students discuss good and bad things they've encountered in open source and/or software development. This aims to get students thinking about good practices for their own repos.

### Mid-internship call: **Coding good practices, providing feedback, and code review**

 **Who attends:**  students, mentors optional but welcome    
 **Call template:** [GitHub](call-templates/code-review) [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@yoyehudi/BJ8cvpvwS)  

  - Group discussion: What makes code good? What makes it awful?
  - Break-out room: students begin by reviewing code of _others_ (i.e. repos that don't belong to the org) in groups of 2-3.
  - Giving feedback: As a group we discuss the importance of giving both positive and negative feedback, and how to do so effectively and compassionately.
  - Break-out room: In groups of 2-3, students bring one of their own repos that they've been working on, and provide each other with feedback.

### End-of-internship Calls
If you have a large community who might attend, consider inviting everyone to see what your interns have been working on over the last few weeks or months. For smaller organisations or umbrella organisations, there might not be a big attendee-base, so consider a final "careers" call instead - or run both sets of calls!

#### Careers
**Who attends:**  Mentors, students/interns, and people who have experience working or hiring in OSS and can provide career tips. Try to get a diverse set of speakers and community-relevant career paths that your students/interns might identify with.
**Call template:**  [GitHub](call-templates/careers-what-next) [HackMD](TBD)  

  - Students/interns share: what they've enjoyed and what they might like to do next - it's okay to be unsure!
  - Breakout discussions with one "senior" community member and 1-2 interns
  - Group report-back and Q&A. 

#### Practice for final presentations

**Who attends:**  Mentors aren't invited to this call, just to give students a safe space to practice with the team.  
**Call template:**  [GitHub](call-templates/final-presentation-practice) [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@yoyehudi/r1D4lxtPBv)  

  - Students/interns are reminded of the feedback exercise we did last call
  - Students/interns present for five minutes, practising what they'll share with the whole community at the end of the month
    - Each other student provides one bit of positive feedback and one suggestion to improve for each talk.

#### Final Evaluation Period: **Final presentations**

**Who attends:** All the wider community is invited.  
**Call template:**  [GitHub](call-templates/final-presentations) [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@yoyehudi/SkNXYlYvB)  

  - Students/interns present their refined presentations, with a strict 5-minute time limit.
