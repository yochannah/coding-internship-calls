## Working practices over the next few months
_(~5 minutes)_

- When in doubt, ask your mentors!
    - This applies for *anything* from technical assistance to blogging or worries about evaluations.
- If theyâ€™re not available or not responsive, you can always approach [insert org admin names here] as org admins - or any of the other mentors if needed.  Weâ€™ll help redirect you to the correct person if we canâ€™t help.
- Updates: Make sure your mentor knows youâ€™re alive and busy!
- Exams, assignments, feeling unwell, vacation coming up? Tell your mentor so they donâ€™t think youâ€™ve disappeared.
- A good way to show youâ€™re alive and working is via github commits. Aim to make small, granular commits and multiple pushes a day. These are your backups as well - computers do break sometimes.
- Social media and blogging:
    - **Blogging:** [add notes about blog policy]
    - **Twitter:** If youâ€™re an active tweeter and youâ€™d like us to retweet something related to your project (e.g. a blog post), be sure to mention [add org twitter handle].
    - **Conferences:** Keep your eye open for open-source conferences that are related to your projects. If theyâ€™re relatively cheap and local we may be able to help you attend - speak with your mentor.

## Final Presentations
As part of your final evaluation, students need to present their projects at a community call. This call will be at [time / date]. See it in your time zone: [insert http://arewemeetingyet.com/ date here]

## ðŸ’¬ What makes a project good?
_Break-out rooms (3-4 people per room, ~10 minutes in breakout rooms + 10 minutes follow up)_

- **When things are a train-wreck:** Think of a time when you tried to use or contribute to an open source project and things didnâ€™t go all that well. What was the reason for this? Was there anything that could have been done better, and why? Perhaps this was community, documentation, code quality, or something else. Discuss in your groups and add your thoughts in the bullet points below. Add more bullets if needed.
    - [name=Your name here] / answer

    - [name=Your name here] / answer
    - [name=Your name here] / answer
- **Now letâ€™s focus on the positive:** Think of a time when you used or contributed to an open source project and things went really smoothly. What things did you really value or appreciate? Discuss in your groups and add your thoughts in the bullet points below. Add more bullets if needed.
